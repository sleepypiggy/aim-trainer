# Aim Trainer Program (incomplete)

## What it is
Basically like the aim trainers you see online like the one at https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/aim. I'm just trying to hone my skills a little more.

## Features and Instructions
Click 'start' on menu to start.

Click 'exit' on menu to exit. 

After starting, click buttons to increase score.

Obviously very much incomplete. There's still stuff to be added.
